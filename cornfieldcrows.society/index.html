<p>Alicia glided over the rooftop of the building and settled on a high ledge near the lit window of Nim’s bedroom. 
She called her Nim, though she did not know her name, knew nothing of her at all; and yet she came, faithfully, 
every night, to watch her in silence. Around midnight the girl would extinguish the light, and then Alicia felt she 
could finally leave. Sometimes she told herself she was protecting her, and the thought delighted her: to be 
something like a fairy godmother could give sense to her fixation, to the hours wasted absorbed in the predictable 
nocturnal routines of a twelve-year-old child. Of course, there was nothing from which to protect her—at least, 
apparently. Yet that night would be the last, and with it came the revelation: Nim leaned out of the window, 
placed a flowerpot carefully upon the sill, opened the palm of her right hand above it, and held the gesture. She 
seemed calm, assured, as though she knew exactly what she was doing. For a moment she turned her head toward 
the room, confirming she was alone, unseen, and waited. Just minutes passed. A plant sprouted from the dark soil, 
rose until it reached her chin, and bloomed in a pale, spectral pink. That was the last time Alicia saw Nim, and 
she would remember her always with that radiant smile, for the girl smiled broadly, seized the blossom with both 
hands, proud, and disappeared into the interior of the dwelling. Alicia imagined her offering it to her mother as a 
gift, or choosing a corner of the hallway or the living room to let it shine. It was a strange and beautiful flower, 
its immense oval petals layering one over another in circles about a fragile cluster of crystalline stamens, as if 
spinning around a frozen core of threads and needles. The rose of the corolla seemed translucent. In the light it 
would be like gazing upon the ghost of a flower, its very spirit. Alicia understood. Nim had brought forth the 
flower at the window so as not to be discovered; her family knew nothing. And Alicia realized that the impulse 
drawing her to this unknown girl she called Nim was this magic—or perhaps it was caused by that very magic. 
She understood that she could, that she knew how to find others like herself, like Nim. She returned the next 
night and perched on the same tree, eager for more. But the girl was not there. It was strange—she had never 
missed a night. No, not strange, she told herself. Nim could be at a friend’s house, with a relative, or away on a 
school trip, any explanation would do. It was not strange. Not at all. And yet it felt strange. A bitter, viscous 
taste slid down her throat, burning her insides. She felt ill, nauseated. These were the sensations she had to 
learn to heed—the very ones that had led her to Nim, that had pulled her time and again to the same high 
branch beside the window. They seized her, attacked her, always unbidden, derailing her plans, leaving her 
confused and unwell. The next night again the room was dark, the bitterness scorching her tongue. She could not 
resist. She drew closer to the window, then to the other windows, circled the walls of the building straining to 
listen. Nim had not returned from school the day before. The police were already involved. The muffled sobs 
and defeated murmurs of her family drifted through the house. It was not difficult to learn: on the third day, the 
local press carried the headline—thirteen-year-old girl found dead in the street, unknown assailant, 
investigation underway, details sealed. No photographs, few particulars, only that the killer had severed the 
middle finger from each hand, likely as a trophy, to relive his deed. They called it a feat in one newspaper. A feat. 
Everything seemed to point to a serial killer, a victim chosen at random, a crime of chance. They wrote that her 
name was Loany, but that her friends called her Nim, because her parents had come from Nîmes, France. Alicia 
read those final lines again and again—the name. Nim. She had invented it. Nim. It was impossible she had 
merely guessed it. And in her mind appeared the image of a madman pleasuring himself with the girl’s severed 
fingers, preserved in a glass jar upon a nightstand. The thought filled her with a fierce, unbearable rage. She was 
no longer certain whether what she imagined was real or not. Nim, the name, had been real; her magic, the 
flower, had been real. Alicia could not escape the same tormenting question, clutching at her stomach, every 
hour of every day: What happened to Nim? she thought, suddenly, again and again, with the bitter venom of that 
last night still burning on her lips. What happened to Nim?</p>
